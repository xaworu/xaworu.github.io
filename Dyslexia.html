				<p><b>Ways To Be Supportive</b></p>
				<p> 1. Be patient with them. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>It is best to be patient with someone who has Dyslexia because it takes them a long time to form sentences and try to get across what they are trying to mean. As well as if they ask you to repeat something over again don’t get frustrated because they are just trying to process what you are saying. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>2. Don't judge the on grammar or how they write</p>
				<ul>
					<li> It is important for teachers to NOT take points off of test or rough draft papers for grammar. This is because even though the student might be able to understand a sentence (with great difficulty), they may not understand how each comma, or semicolon is used throughout the writing or test. Also do not tease someone who has dyslexia about spelling because it is something they can’t help.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>3. Give more in depth explanations(if they ask)</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It helps when you tell a person with dyslexia what you want them to do in more depth. This allows them to get a different point of view, as well as the more information about what it is you want them to do.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><b>Tips to help in the future:</b></p>
				<ul>
				<li>1. Stay organized</li>
				<li>2. Rewrite vocabulary words</li>
				<li>3. Say words out loud when writing words they don't understand</li>
				<li>4. Have powerpoints before and or during a presentation</li>
				<li>5. Read paper or writting assignments out loud</li>
